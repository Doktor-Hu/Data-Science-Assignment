Introduction: This is the Jupyter Notebook for the `Data Science Assignment - Team Forecasting` project. The aim is to . The datasets used are
-  The file `sales_data.csv` with 4 time series of sales at (total, retailer_type_1, retailer_type_2 and retailer_type_3).
-  
- a

The experimented models are:
- ARIMA (a classic statistical model for time-series as baseline), and
- XGBoost (a prevalently used machine learning model)

After experiments and validation, I decided to use the XGBoost model for the final forecast.
